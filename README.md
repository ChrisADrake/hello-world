Tutorial repository to learn how to use GitHub
I am starting on GitHub to enter the game and app development world after dropping out of college for computer science over 8 years ago. 
The first appI will work on will be a simple habit tracker that can keep track of user made habits or goals and keep track of user made rewards or reward points to cash in for general habits/goals. I am working on this with a close friend from high school.

Tutorial repository to learn how to use GitHub
I am starting on GitHub to enter the game and app development world. 
The first app I will work on will be a simple habit tracker that can keep track of user made habits or goals and keep track of user made rewards or reward points to cash in for general habits/goals.
I am working on this with a close friend from high school.
